# AU-Marketing-Strategy
Our objective is to look at the current marketing tactics utilized by American University and see how exactly they compare to each other in terms of the number of applications submitted for online graduate programs. We believe that (1) effective marketing will correlate with a higher rate of applications submitted and (2) applications submitted is an accurate measure of the effective reach of the marketing campaign. We focus on the efficiency of online marketing compared to traditional marketing and whether or not online marketing is worth investing more money.
